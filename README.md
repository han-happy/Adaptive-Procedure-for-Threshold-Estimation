# Psych14P-final

Spring 2023, Psych / Cogs 14P Final Project with Dr. Srinivasan  
Teammates consist of Quiana and Bin

Adaptive Procedure for Threshold Estimation
* there are two parts to this project: the experiment and the data visualization
* the experiment is an audio test.
  * if two notes of different pitches are played, one after the other, can the subject hear the difference?
  * the order of the two notes played (higher first or higher second) is randomized
  * for every trial the subject gets right, the difference in pitch between the two notes decreases
  * the 3 subjects are my two teammates and myself
* the data visualization
  * shows the progression of the difference in pitch decreasing and when the subject starts to struggle, their threshold estimate
